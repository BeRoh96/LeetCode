// A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).
function isPangram(string) {
  return "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    .split("")
    .every((x) => string.toLowerCase().includes(x));
